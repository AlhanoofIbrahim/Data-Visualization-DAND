## Summary of Findings


>I get some information about flights in January 2019. In the exploration data, I get some insights about the days that have the highest trip in a week or in a month, also I know what are the best 3 cities as destinations cities. My focus also was in the delays in flights and after all analysis, I get that if the distance in increasing the weather delay could occur, in the arrival delays it get a stronger relationship between other two types of the delays (carrier/weather) delays it's like a linear relationship between them. 

>In the end, I think these insights may help the airline company and customer, by choosing the best day to make some offer to the customer or to avoid any day that has many diverted flights.
